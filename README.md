# Flybrain

**Every neuron of a fruit fly's brain, switched on.**

Flybrain simulates all **138,639 neurons** and **15.1 million connections** of the adult *Drosophila* brain. Stimulate any cell type and watch the signal spread, from taste or vision to the neurons that move the body. There's a 3D lab, a plain-language command center, and a Python simulator that runs on a laptop.

Built by [Dhruv Agrawat](https://github.com/dhruvagrawat).

## What's inside

- **The lab.** A WebGL map of every neuron at its real position, replaying experiments spike by spike. Brain output readout (feeding, escape, walking), population chart, spike raster, neuron table, experiment log and run comparison.
- **Command center.** Press <kbd>⌘K</kbd> and type `stimulate sugar at 200 hz, silence CB0248, run`.
- **Animated explainers.** A live neuron you drive with sliders, and a toy circuit you can lesion by clicking.
- **Simulator.** A NumPy + Numba reimplementation of the Shiu et al. (2024) whole-brain model: one simulated second in ~9 s on one CPU core.
- **Docs.** Guides, model details, API reference, [roadmap](ROADMAP.md), [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and a [lab notebook](NOTEBOOK.md) of experiment results.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhruvagrawat/fly-brain-sim && cd fly-brain-sim
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m flybrain fetch            # ~140 MB of connectome data, once
python -m flybrain serve            # the lab at http://127.0.0.1:8050
```

Or straight from the terminal:

```bash
python -m flybrain run --stim sugar --rate 200 --trials 10
python -m flybrain run --stim looming --silence DNp01
```

Stimulating sugar-taste neurons activates ~430 neurons and drives the feeding motor neuron MN9 at ~115 Hz, reproducing the paper's key result.

### Web app

```bash
cd web && npm install
npm run dev        # develop on :3000
npm run build      # static site in web/out/, which `flybrain serve` also serves
```

Deploys to Vercel with no settings: import the repo at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new). The hosted site replays recorded experiments and can connect to a local `flybrain serve` for live runs.
